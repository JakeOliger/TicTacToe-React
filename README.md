## Tic-Tac-Toe React Tutorial

The basic [React.js tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) with all extra tasks completed and some additional styling performed to make it look nicer. Completed by Jake Oliger on June 5th, 2018.

The extra tasks prescribed by the tutorial are
* Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
* Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
* Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
* Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
* When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
* When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

In addition, I've added
* Replay functionality, so you can re-watch the game without clicking through each move
